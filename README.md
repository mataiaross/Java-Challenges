# Java-Challenges
Mad Libs
In this project, weâ€™ll use Java to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

Math Magic
In this project, I become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.
